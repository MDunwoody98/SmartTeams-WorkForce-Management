# COMPONENTS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The components directory contains your Vue.js Components.

_Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components._

Components are what makes up the different parts of your page and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.
