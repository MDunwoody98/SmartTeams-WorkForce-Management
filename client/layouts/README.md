# LAYOUTS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your Application Layouts.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/views#layouts).

Layouts are like reusable HTML pages.
In a pages/ file, if you define the template then the pages data will appear inside the layout you specified for the page.
If a layout has a Nuxt tag, then a page that uses that layout will insert the page template into the Nuxt node. 

Pages can also include components by including a <ComponentFileName> node
